# hello-world

Whaddup:
My name is Cordell and I am a graduated Business Analyst. I learned a lot about data modeling and
visualizing but my goal is to get better at preprocessing by writing code in python and R and running SQL queries. 
I also would like to learn at least two more languanes C++ and the big one Java (that's far down the road)
